# Description

The following data was collected with a research survey attached to an interactive big five personality test on the internet between April 2019 and June 2019. The research survey consisted of questions that were selected to show a large difference between firstborn and later born children, see https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/birthorder/development/. The personality test was the IPIP Five Factor Markers.

Subjects found the test on the internet and were motivated by the prospect of personalized results. At the end of the personality test, they were asked if their answers could be used for research and if they would be willing to take an additional research survey as well. This dataset only includes those who agreed to take the optional survey.
